# rough volatility calibrator

Volatility models calibrated on real SPX options data, from Black-Scholes to Rough Bergomi.

BS assumes constant vol. Markets don't. This project builds from the BS baseline through Heston
to the Rough Bergomi model (Bayer, Friz, Gatheral 2016), which captures the empirical roughness
of volatility with H ≈ 0.1 and reproduces the short-term implied vol smile that classical models
fail to fit.


## Why Rough Bergomi

The volatility smile, the fact that implied vol varies across strikes, is a well-known failure
of Black-Scholes. Heston partially fixes this but breaks down at short maturities.

Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum (2018) showed that realized volatility behaves like a fractional
Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H ≈ 0.1, far rougher than standard BM. The Rough Bergomi
model encodes this directly and fits the SPX smile with very few parameters.
